Infinity
I used the infinite extent of my world to represent a beautiful beach sunset that the viewer can scroll through!

Variation in Space
As the audience browses my world, theyâ€™ll see different biomes to explore. As the scroll to the right or left the beach with gradually change to a rocky section then finally into a grassy section as to mimic a real life beach.

Variations in Key
Different worlds will have different sun locations, beach and grasslands foliage!

Signs of Life
Clicking on water tiles causes a small ripple to occur. Clicking on sand tiles causes the viewer to place a seashell, rock, or starfish at random! While the passage of time results in the viewer being able to see the waves as they sweep by, enhancing the reflection from the sun.
