explain how the Colors, Primitives, Polygons, Generativity, and Life

EXPERIMENT 02 - LIVING IMPRESSIONS
DATE: 04/14/2025

Colors: 
The image depicts a beautiful sunset gradients of orange, red, blue, purple, and yellows. Thus, I made sure that was at the forfront of my generated image. In the same vein a lot of green in the form of foliage is depicted, thus I added a nice green landscape and a tree.

Primitives: 
The tree's leaves in my generated image are made up of circles which replace themseleves after each frame to simulate the wind.

Polygons:
I made the trunk of the tree using beizer curves and connected them to make a more dynamic looking trunk for my tree. Using the required beginShape() and endShape() functions.

Generativity:
As the seed changes the image changes completely. For example, the size of the tree trunk, tree's leaves, cloud density, cloud shape, background foliage, and grass location.

Life:
The leaves on the tree changes between frames simulating the wind passing through the leaves, in the same vein the grass at the bottom of the frame slowly sways to provide a feeling of calmness.
