				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Dungeons are the cornerstone of rougelike gameplay whether it be above or below ground. I used dungeons as my inspiration for today and created an everchanging landscape with trees, houses, ponds, and a nice field. As you increase the seed you'll see the shape of the dungeon change, the trees, houses, ponds all change locations. Beyond that you'll notice a creeping fungal infestation inside the dungeon, noted by the red and gray tiles. Additonally, it looks like some fish may be active in the pond with all those bubbles changing!</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Autotiling and Life!</p>
				<p>Going step by step here are some of the most interesting portions of this assignment:</p>

				<p>The changing of the walls to compliment the different dungeon sizes was thanks to a lookup array that assisted me in finding complimentary tiles with context information based on neighboring tiles. After recieving this information, I used a function that offset the current tile to create a smooth transtition from the tile I just placed. This was all possible due to assigning a 4-bit code to every tile that I then assessed before placing down the next tile to ensure smooth transitions.</p>

				<p>Then, to create the "living" portion of the level design, I utilized noise functions to change the tiles on a whim. This is how the funal infestations spreads and how the bubbles in the pond change.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>In the end, I felt challenged by the process but Iâ€™m coming out of it with a better understanding of generative design. I feel very satisfied with my final result and while I could have added more aspects that would elevate it further, while the amount of effort I put in may not show, I am happy with the result.</p>
