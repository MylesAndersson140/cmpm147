EXPERIMENT 03 - ALTERNATE WORLDS
DATE: 04/21/2025

Autotiling logic: I opted to create a dunegeon level and thus my autotiling logic came in the form of dynamic walls that shape around the dungeon. I did struggle with the implementation of the changing corners and dimentions, I got the product to a place where I was happy with the result. If I had more time and knowledge, I would have liked to figure out how to only paint half of one tile.
