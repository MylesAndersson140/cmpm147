				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this programming assignment, we're building a generator that directly reads inspiring images, renders parameterized images, and adjusts its own designs to optimize an evaluation score.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
                <p>This project integrates inspiring images that are selectable from the drop-down on the display page.</p>
                <p>This program parses an image and attempts to recreate it using different shapes, such as: rectangles, circles, and triangles. It undergoes many evolutions in response to mutation rates which changes how the different shapes look depending on what a previous render got as a score of resemblance. The "Auto Anneal" button allows the user to sit back and see what happens as the mutation rate slowly goes down, if you squint you will see a resemblance of the original image. Additionally, the user is able to see this evolution first hand by clicking the "show evolution" button and be presented with the ability to start/pause and increase/decrease the speed of the animation.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Ultimately, this experiment was less difficult for me compared to the previous ones, due to the starter code offered by Prof. Wes Modes. I felt pleasantly challenged by the experiment because I felt like it was more focused on the creative portion of the assignment as opposed to simply checking off requirements. I felt more free to express what I really wanted out of this experiment as a result, and I greatly appreciate that. I feel very satisfied with my final result and while I could have added more aspects that would elevate it further, I believe that I did the original images justice by bringing them to life. Lastly, here is a link to my repository with experiment five</p>
