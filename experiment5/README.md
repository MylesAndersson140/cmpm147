EXPERIMENT 04 - EVOLUTIONARY IMPRESSIONS

Base program functionality credit goes to Prof. Wes Modes, including image parsing, rendering, and mutation.

This program parses an image and attempts to recreate it using different shapes, such as: rectangles, circles, and triangles. It undergoes many evolutions in response to mutation rates which changes how the different shapes look depending on what a previous render got as a score of resemblance. The "Auto Anneal" button allows the user to sit back and see what happens as the mutation rate slowly goes down, if you squint you will see a resemblance of the original image. Additionally, the user is able to see this evolution first hand by clicking the "show evolution" button and be presented with the ability to start/pause and increase/decrease the speed of the animation.

Ultimately, this experiment was less difficult for me compared to the previous ones, due to the starter code offered by Prof. Wes Modes. I felt pleasantly challenged by the experiment because I felt like it was more focused on the creative portion of the assignment as opposed to simply checking off requirements. I felt more free to express what I really wanted out of this experiment as a result, and I greatly appreciate that. I feel very satisfied with my final result and while I could have added more aspects that would elevate it further, I believe that I did the original images justice by bringing them to life.
